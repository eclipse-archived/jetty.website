Note: The canonical repository for Jetty is Maven Central.  All releases are always available there first and this page may lag a bit update wise as post release resources are put into place.  You can always browse for Jetty releases http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/jetty-distribution[here].
