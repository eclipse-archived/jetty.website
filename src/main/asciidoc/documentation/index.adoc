The documentation is for Jetty is a continual work in progress.

Jetty documentation is a community effort and is bundled in with the link:http://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project[Jetty source] on GitHub. 
We invite contributors to fork the Jetty repository and contribute! 
More information can be found in the link:/jetty/documentation/9.3.9.v20160517/contributing-documentation.html[Contributing Documentation] section.

You can also download many PDF versions of the documentation from Webtide at http://www.webtide.com. 
Updated PDF's will be available as we release new Jetty versions and once registered are located under the Downloads section of the website.

Documentation for many versions of Jetty 9 are available here. 
Generally speaking the current documentation is most useful however we provide these snapshots of the documentation at specific release points for reference.
