== Eclipse Details

Eclipse Jetty is largely managed as an Eclipse project under the https://www.eclipse.org/rt[Runtime] project.  This is a loosely managed grouping of runtime related projects.

The Eclipse project management tooling provides a summary page which contains general information about the project.  The IPLog is a collection of dependencies that have been approved through the Eclipse CQ process.
